# Student & Payment Tracker

This is a web application I am building to help a small school (Maternelle & Tutoring Center) manage their business. 

## Why I built this
My aunt called Amina runs a school and used to track everything on paper. I built this app to help her digitize her student records and track monthly payments more easily. This is my first real-world project using Node.js.

## Current Status: Work in Progress (WIP) 🚧
I am still a student and I am learning every day. This project is **not finished yet**. I am constantly adding new features and improving the code as I learn more about backend development.

## Features
* **Student Management:** Add and view student information.
* **Payment Tracking:** Keep track of who has paid and who has not.
* **Digital Records:** Moving from paper to a digital database.

## Technologies Used
* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* **JavaScript**
* **HTML/CSS**

## How to use it
1. Clone the folder.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `node server.js` (or `npm start`).
